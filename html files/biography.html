        <p style = "width:50%; color:#62ff00">
            I, Emmanuel Lopez-Vanegas son of Nasly Vanegas and Luis Fernando Lopez. I have a sister, Vanessa Lopez-Vanegas and a dog named Napoleon. I was born in Canada on June 3rd of 2008 in Whitchurch-Stouffville Hospital. I moved to Florida, United States in 2016 and lived there for approximately 4 years. I moved back to Canada due to Covid-19 in the middle of 2020. I first lived in Markham like I had previously for a year but then moved to Stouffville and am here to this day. I have been to a few schools and played the Violin in 5th Grade. I am now starting a Company named Prone Technologies. I enjoy casual video games and like writing code sometimes. I have a few games that I've made over time  and I will link them to the assignment. I don't have a favorite food because I enjoy nearly everything and even if I don't I will still eat it. I cook so I guess I would argue that I enjoy the food I cook for myself and for my family. I want to become a Computer Engineer after High School and specialize in Hardware Development.
