        <h2>Graphics</h2>
        <p style = "width:50%" >
            Has very pixelated and blocky graphics. Is easy to run and gets a decent FPS. Although it is blocky there is a lot of detail making it a rather immersive world. Can add mods to change the looks of the default blocks and even make it look realistic.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p style = "width:50%">
            You need to break blocks such as Wood, and Stone. This allows you to craft weapons and different blocks. You survive by seeking shelter, wearing armor, and fighting mobs. The goal of the game is to beat the Ender Dragon.

        <h2>Storyline/Multiplayer</h2>
        <p style = "width:50%">
            The Storyline is very basic. Main character (you) gets items, crafts new items, kills monsters, and beats Ender Dragon. The Multiplayer is used with the servers function in Java and in Bedrock you can simply invite people to your own world. Servers allow for a larger player base to be on at the same time.

        <h2>Sound</h2>
        <p style = "width:50%">
            The games soundtrack is rather Iconic. It is very pleasing to hear and adds immersion to the game. Although one would think that visuals are kind of funky, the sound adds and makes the game a lot better(donâ€™t play without sound please).
